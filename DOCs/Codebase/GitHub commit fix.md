The repository is now in a clean state, and the local branch is up to date with the remote branch. 

The large files have been removed from the Git history, and the changes have been successfully pushed to the remote repository.

Let's summarize what we did and provide some recommendations for the future:

## Summary of what we did:
1. Identified large files in your Git history (two 1.2GB files and several large image files)
2. Created a backup branch for safety
3. Used `git filter-branch` to remove the large files from Git history
4. Cleaned up Git references with `git reflog expire` and `git gc`
5. Force-pushed the cleaned history to GitHub

## Recommendations for the future:
1. **Continue using your .gitignore file**: Your .gitignore file is already well-configured to exclude large binary files.
2. **Consider using Git LFS for large files**: If you need to track large files in your repository, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage).
3. **Be careful with binary files**: Always be cautious when committing binary files, especially large ones. Check what you're committing before you do so with `git status` or `git add -p`.
4. **Regular housekeeping**: Periodically check for large files in your repository with the command we used:
   ```
   git ls-tree -r -l HEAD | sort -k 4 -n -r | head -10
   ```

Your repository should now be much more manageable and you shouldn't encounter the HTTP 500 error when pushing to GitHub anymore.
