# Quick Start Guide - Enhanced Cell Segmentation Visualization

## Problem Solved

The previous visualization scripts had two main issues:
1.  **Invisible Cell Boundaries**: The coordinate transformation was incorrect, so boundaries were not displayed.
2.  **Identical DAPI/PolyT Plots**: The script was not correctly loading and differentiating between image channels.

## The Solution: `visualize_segmentation_fixed.py`

This updated script is the **recommended tool** for all visualizations. It resolves the previous issues and adds significant enhancements.

### Key Features
- **Accurate Boundary Overlay**: Correctly transforms coordinates so cell boundaries are precisely overlaid on the images.
- **3-Panel Output**: Generates a single, comprehensive PNG for each tile, showing:
    1.  DAPI channel with boundaries.
    2.  PolyT channel with boundaries.
    3.  A merged RGB overlay (Red: PolyT, Green/Blue: DAPI) for easy channel comparison.
- **High-Visibility Boundaries**: Boundaries are now rendered as a thick, vibrant **yellow** line, making them easy to see.
- **High-Resolution Images**: Outputs are saved at 300 DPI for clear, detailed analysis.

## Quick Commands

**Always use `visualize_segmentation_fixed.py` for reliable results.**

### 1. Visualize a Single Tile
This is the most common use case. To see the results for tile 4:
```bash
python CHECK_RESEGMENTATION_RESULTS/visualize_segmentation_fixed.py --tile-index 4
```
**Output**: A detailed 3-panel image will be saved to `segmentation_visualizations/tile_4_segmentation.png`.

### 2. Visualize All Tiles with Cells
To process every tile where cells were detected:
```bash
python CHECK_RESEGMENTATION_RESULTS/visualize_segmentation_fixed.py --all-tiles
```
**Output**: Separate 3-panel images for each tile will be saved in `segmentation_visualizations/`.

### 3. Use a Custom Save Location
To save the output to a different directory:
```bash
python CHECK_RESEGMENTATION_RESULTS/visualize_segmentation_fixed.py --tile-index 4 --save-dir ./my_custom_results
```

### 4. Get a Quick Summary
To see a report of detected cells per tile without generating images:
```bash
python CHECK_RESEGMENTATION_RESULTS/visualize_segmentation_fixed.py --summary-only
```

## How to Check Your Results

1.  **Run one of the commands above.**
2.  **Look in the output directory** (default is `segmentation_visualizations/`).
3.  **Open the generated PNG file(s)** to view the 3-panel plot and assess the segmentation quality.

This updated workflow provides a more reliable and informative way to visualize your segmentation results.
